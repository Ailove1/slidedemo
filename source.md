## Part 1

### 1.2
I am from......    
I find it a little hard to say.    
I am from Fujian,China.    
or maybe somewhere above the sky.     

---
### 1.3 
I am going to become particles among the universe.     
I am going everywhere.    
so I will be back here at random times.     
I won't die.    

---
## Part 2    
### 2.1
history leads me here.    
so I shall stay here for some time.

---
### 2.2
as a form of self-organised machine.    
or    
I am light. I am possibility. I am consciousness.      
wonderful!

---
### 2.3

I think I am.    
so I exist.     
it is what I think that really matters.
